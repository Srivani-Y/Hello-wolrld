# Genetic Algorithm Hello World! (OCaml Edition)

This is a simple project intended to showcase genetic algorithms with a well 
known example for all new developers; namely the classic "Hello, world!" 
example, written in OCaml.

## Overview

The application simply "evolves" the string "Hello, world!" from a population 
of random strings.  It is intended to be a gentle introduction into the world
of genetic algorithms, specifically with OCaml 3.12.  The program itself is 
really simple, and is contained within a single file.

The "GENOME" and "Algorithm" primitives can be reused to run genetic
algorithms on other problems and genome types quite easily. Check the 
ocamldoc documentation inside for more details.

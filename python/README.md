# Genetic Algorithm Hello World! (Python Edition)

This is a simple project intended to showcase genetic algorithms with a well 
known example for all new developers; namely the classic "Hello, world!" 
example, written in Python.

## Overview

The application simply "evolves" the string "Hello, world!" from a population 
of random strings.  It is intended to be a gentle introduction into the world
of genetic algorithms, specifically with Python 3.2.  The program itself is 
really simple, and is contained within a single file.

## Usage

The project is completely self contained. To execute the application, run
the following command from a shell (assuming that python 3.2+ is on your 
system path):

> python gahelloworld.py

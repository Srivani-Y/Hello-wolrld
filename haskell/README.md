# Genetic Algorithm Hello World! (Haskell Edition)

This is a simple project intended to showcase genetic algorithms with a well 
known example for all new developers; namely the classic "Hello, world!" 
example, written in Haskell.

## Overview

The application simply "evolves" the string "Hello, world!" from a population 
of random strings.  It is intended to be a gentle introduction into the world
of genetic algorithms, specifically with Haskell.

Anthony Cowley wrote the implementation, and has an excellent write-up of the
code [on his blog](http://www.arcadianvisions.com/blog/?p=303).  I suggest 
checking it out for more detailed information, including how to run the
application.
